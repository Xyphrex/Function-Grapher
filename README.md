# Function Grapher
Function Grapher is a terminal-based graphing calculator program written in Python. It allows users to input equations of lines and see the corresponding function graphed on a Cartesian plane in the terminal.

## How to Use
Run the program by executing the Python script.
Enter the equation of the line when prompted.
The program will calculate the y values for x values ranging from -50 to 50 and print the graph on the Cartesian plane.
* Use "^" to raise a term to the power of the following number

## Bugs
As the program is still under development it is plagued with many bugs and possible crashes. These will be fixed in future commits.
